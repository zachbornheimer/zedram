zedram
======

The Zedram Language is a flexible language designed for data representation and modeling.

The Zedram Language can be parsed by other languages (such as Perl, C, Java, PHP, Python, etc. [eventually])or compiled into other XML based languages.

This project is currently pre-alpha and written in Perl6.

Note, if you cannot access the Zedram::Grammar or Zedram::Parser modules, make sure to include . in your path.
You may have to run `perl6 -I . compiler.pl6` to test the program as opposed to `perl6 compiler.pl6`

Current To-Do

* Implement read method in Parser.pm6
